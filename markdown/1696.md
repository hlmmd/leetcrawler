You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

You are initially standing at index `0`. In one move, you can jump at most `k`
steps forward without going outside the boundaries of the array. That is, you
can jump from index `i` to any index in the range `[i + 1, min(n - 1, i + k)]`
**inclusive**.

You want to reach the last index of the array (index `n - 1`). Your **score**
is the **sum** of all `nums[j]` for each index `j` you visited in the array.

Return _the **maximum score** you can get_.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [ _1_ , _-1_ ,-2, _4_ ,-7, _3_ ], k = 2
    Output: 7
    Explanation: You can choose your jumps forming the subsequence [1,-1,4,3] (underlined above). The sum is 7.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [ _10_ ,-5,-2, _4_ ,0, _3_ ], k = 3
    Output: 17
    Explanation: You can choose your jumps forming the subsequence [10,4,3] (underlined above). The sum is 17.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1,-5,-20,4,-1,3,-6,-3], k = 2
    Output: 0
    



**Constraints:**

  *  `1 <= nums.length, k <= 105`
  * `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
