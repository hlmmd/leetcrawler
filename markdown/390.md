You have a list `arr` of all integers in the range `[1, n]` sorted in a
strictly increasing order. Apply the following algorithm on `arr`:

  * Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
  * Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the rightmost number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
  * Keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.

Given the integer `n`, return _the last number that remains in_ `arr`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: n = 9
    Output: 6
    Explanation:
    arr = [ _1_ , 2, _3_ , 4, _5_ , 6, _7_ , 8, _9_ ]
    arr = [2, _4_ , 6, _8_ ]
    arr = [ _2_ , 6]
    arr = [6]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: n = 1
    Output: 1
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 109`
