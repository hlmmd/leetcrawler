Given the `root` of a binary tree, consider all _root to leaf paths_ : paths
from the root to any leaf.  (A leaf is a node with no children.)

A `node` is _insufficient_ if  **every** such root to leaf path intersecting
this `node` has sum strictly less than `limit`.

Delete all insufficient nodes simultaneously, and return the root of the
resulting binary tree.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/06/05/insufficient-11.png)Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,-99,-99,7,8,9,-99,-99,12,13,-99,14], limit = 1
    **![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/06/05/insufficient-2.png)Output:** [1,2,3,4,null,null,7,8,9,null,14]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/06/05/insufficient-3.png)Input:** root = [5,4,8,11,null,17,4,7,1,null,null,5,3], limit = 22
    **![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/06/05/insufficient-4.png)Output:** [5,4,8,11,null,17,4,7,null,null,null,5]



**Example 3:**

    
    
    **![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/06/11/screen-shot-2019-06-11-at-83301-pm.png)Input:** root = [1,2,-3,-5,null,4,null], limit = -1
    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/06/11/screen-shot-2019-06-11-at-83517-pm.png)Output: [1,null,-3,4]



**Note:**

  1. The given tree will have between `1` and `5000` nodes.
  2. `-10^5 <= node.val <= 10^5`
  3. `-10^9 <= limit <= 10^9`
