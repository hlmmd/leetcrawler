We have a two dimensional matrix `grid` where each value is `0` or `1`.

A move consists of choosing any row or column, and toggling each value in that
row or column: changing all `0`s to `1`s, and all `1`s to `0`s.

After making any number of moves, every row of this matrix is interpreted as a
binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return the highest possible score.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: grid = [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
    Output: 39
    Explanation: Toggled to [[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]].
    0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= grid.length <= 20`
  2. `1 <= grid[0].length <= 20`
  3. `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
