You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `multipliers` **** of size `n` and
`m` respectively, where `n >= m`. The arrays are **1-indexed**.

You begin with a score of `0`. You want to perform **exactly** `m` operations.
On the `ith` operation **(1-indexed)** , you will:

  * Choose one integer `x` from **either the start or the end** of the array `nums`.
  * Add `multipliers[i] * x` to your score.
  * Remove `x` from the array `nums`.

Return _the **maximum** score after performing _`m` _operations._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1,2,3], multipliers = [3,2,1]
    Output: 14
    Explanation:  An optimal solution is as follows:
    - Choose from the end, [1,2, ** _3_** ], adding 3 * 3 = 9 to the score.
    - Choose from the end, [1, ** _2_** ], adding 2 * 2 = 4 to the score.
    - Choose from the end, [ ** _1_** ], adding 1 * 1 = 1 to the score.
    The total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], multipliers = [-10,-5,3,4,6]
    Output: 102
    Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
    - Choose from the start, [ _ **-5**_ ,-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -5 * -10 = 50 to the score.
    - Choose from the start, [ ** _-3_** ,-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * -5 = 15 to the score.
    - Choose from the start, [ ** _-3_** ,-2,7,1], adding -3 * 3 = -9 to the score.
    - Choose from the end, [-2,7, ** _1_** ], adding 1 * 4 = 4 to the score.
    - Choose from the end, [-2, ** _7_** ], adding 7 * 6 = 42 to the score. 
    The total score is 50 + 15 - 9 + 4 + 42 = 102.
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `m == multipliers.length`
  * `1 <= m <= 103`
  * `m <= n <= 105`` `
  * `-1000 <= nums[i], multipliers[i] <= 1000`
