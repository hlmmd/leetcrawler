Given an integer `n`, you must transform it into `0` using the following
operations any number of times:

  * Change the rightmost (`0th`) bit in the binary representation of `n`.
  * Change the `ith` bit in the binary representation of `n` if the `(i-1)th` bit is set to `1` and the `(i-2)th` through `0th` bits are set to `0`.

Return _the minimum number of operations to transform_`n` _into_`0` _._



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: n = 0
    Output: 0
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
    " _1_ 1" -> " _0_ 1" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
    "0 _1_ " -> "0 _0_ " with the 1st operation.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: n = 6
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".
    " _1_ 10" -> " _0_ 10" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.
    "01 _0_ " -> "01 _1_ " with the 1st operation.
    "0 _1_ 1" -> "0 _0_ 1" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
    "00 _1_ " -> "00 _0_ " with the 1st operation.
    

**Example 4:**

    
    
    Input: n = 9
    Output: 14
    

**Example 5:**

    
    
    Input: n = 333
    Output: 393
    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= n <= 109`
