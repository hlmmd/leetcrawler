Given a positive integer `n`, find and return _the **longest distance**
between any two **adjacent** _`1` _' s in the binary representation of _`n` _.
If there are no two adjacent_`1` _' s, return _`0` _._

Two `1`'s are **adjacent** if there are only `0`'s separating them (possibly
no `0`'s). The **distance** between two `1`'s is the absolute difference
between their bit positions. For example, the two `1`'s in `"1001"` have a
distance of 3.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: n = 22
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 22 in binary is "10110".
    The first adjacent pair of 1's is " _1_ 0 _1_ 10" with a distance of 2.
    The second adjacent pair of 1's is "10 _11_ 0" with a distance of 1.
    The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
    Note that " _1_ 01 _1_ 0" is not a valid pair since there is a 1 separating the two 1's underlined.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: n = 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 5 in binary is "101".
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: n = 6
    Output: 1
    Explanation: 6 in binary is "110".
    

**Example 4:**

    
    
    Input: n = 8
    Output: 0
    Explanation: 8 in binary is "1000".
    There aren't any adjacent pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.
    

**Example 5:**

    
    
    Input: n = 1
    Output: 0
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 109`
