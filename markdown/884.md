We are given two sentences `s1` and `s2`.  (A _sentence_  is a string of space
separated words.  Each _word_ consists only of lowercase letters.)

A word is _uncommon_  if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and
does not appear in the other sentence.

Return a list of all uncommon words.

You may return the list in any order.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"
    Output: ["sweet","sour"]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"
    Output: ["banana"]
    



**Note:**

  1. `0 <= s1.length <= 200`
  2. `0 <= s2.length <= 200`
  3. `s1` and `s2` both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.
