You are given an array `target` that consists of **distinct** integers and
another integer array `arr` that **can** have duplicates.

In one operation, you can insert any integer at any position in `arr`. For
example, if `arr = [1,4,1,2]`, you can add `3` in the middle and make it
`[1,4, _3_ ,1,2]`. Note that you can insert the integer at the very beginning
or end of the array.

Return _the **minimum** number of operations needed to make _`target` _a
**subsequence** of _`arr` _._

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array generated from the original array
by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining
elements' relative order. For example, `[2,7,4]` is a subsequence of `[4, _2_
,3, _7_ ,2,1, _4_ ]` (the underlined elements), while `[2,4,2]` is not.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: target = [5,1,3], arr = [9,4,2,3,4]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: You can add 5 and 1 in such a way that makes arr = [ _5_ ,9,4, _1_ ,2,3,4], then target will be a subsequence of arr.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: target = [6,4,8,1,3,2], arr = [4,7,6,2,3,8,6,1]
    Output: 3
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= target.length, arr.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= target[i], arr[i] <= 109`
  * `target` contains no duplicates.
