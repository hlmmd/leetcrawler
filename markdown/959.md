An `n x n` grid is composed of `1 x 1` squares where each `1 x 1` square
consists of a `'/'`, `'\'`, or blank space `' '`. These characters divide the
square into contiguous regions.

Given the grid `grid` represented as a string array, return _the number of
regions_.

Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a `'\'` is represented as
`'\\'`.



**Example 1:**

    Input: grid = [" /","/ "]
    Output: 2
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/2.png)

    
    
    Input: grid = [" /","  "]
    Output: 1
    

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/3.png)

    
    
    Input: grid = ["\\/","/\\"]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.)
    

**Example 4:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/4.png)

    
    
    Input: grid = ["/\\","\\/"]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.)
    

**Example 5:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/5.png)

    
    
    Input: grid = ["//","/ "]
    Output: 3
    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= n <= 30`
  * `grid[i][j]` is either `'/'`, `'\'`, or `' '`.
