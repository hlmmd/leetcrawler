Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the
minimum window in`s` which will contain all the characters in `t`_. If there
is no such window in `s` that covers all characters in `t`, return _the empty
string`""`_.

**Note** that If there is such a window, it is guaranteed that there will
always be only one unique minimum window in `s`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
    Output: "BANC"
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: s = "a", t = "a"
    Output: "a"
    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == s.length`
  * `n == t.length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 105`
  * `s` and `t` consist of English letters.



**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?
