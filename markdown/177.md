Write a SQL query to get the _n_ th highest salary from the `Employee` table.

    
    
    +----+--------+
    | Id | Salary |
    +----+--------+
    | 1  | 100    |
    | 2  | 200    |
    | 3  | 300    |
    +----+--------+
    

For example, given the above Employee table, the _n_ th highest salary where
_n_ = 2 is `200`. If there is no _n_ th highest salary, then the query should
return `null`.

    
    
    +------------------------+
    | getNthHighestSalary(2) |
    +------------------------+
    | 200                    |
    +------------------------+
