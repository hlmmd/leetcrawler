Given two strings `s` and `t`, return _the number of distinct subsequences
of`s` which equals `t`_.

A string's **subsequence** is a new string formed from the original string by
deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining
characters' relative positions. (i.e., `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"`
while `"AEC"` is not).

It is guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
    **_rabb_** b ** _it_**
    **_ra_** b ** _bbit_**
    **_rab_** b ** _bit_**
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
    Output: 5
    Explanation:
    As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
    **_ba_** b _ **g**_ bag
    **_ba_** bgba ** _g_**
    _**b**_ abgb ** _ag_**
    ba _ **b**_ gb _ **ag**_
    babg ** _bag_**



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`
  * `s` and `t` consist of English letters.
