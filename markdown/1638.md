Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the number of ways you can choose a non-
empty substring of `s` and replace a **single character** by a different
character such that the resulting substring is a substring of `t`. In other
words, find the number of substrings in `s` that differ from some substring in
`t` by **exactly** one character.

For example, the underlined substrings in `" _compute_ r"` and `" _computa_
tion"` only differ by the `'e'`/`'a'`, so this is a valid way.

Return _the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above._

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: s = "aba", t = "baba"
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by exactly 1 character:
    (" _a_ ba", " _b_ aba")
    (" _a_ ba", "ba _b_ a")
    ("ab _a_ ", " _b_ aba")
    ("ab _a_ ", "ba _b_ a")
    ("a _b_ a", "b _a_ ba")
    ("a _b_ a", "bab _a_ ")
    The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.
    

​​ **Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: s = "ab", t = "bb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by 1 character:
    (" _a_ b", " _b_ b")
    (" _a_ b", "b _b_ ")
    (" _ab_ ", " _bb_ ")
    ​​​​The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: s = "a", t = "a"
    Output: 0
    

**Example 4:**

    
    
    Input: s = "abe", t = "bbc"
    Output: 10
    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 100`
  * `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters only.
