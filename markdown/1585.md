Given two strings `s` and `t`, you want to transform string `s` into string
`t` using the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose a **non-empty** substring in `s` and sort it in-place so the characters are in  **ascending order**.

For example, applying the operation on the underlined substring in `"1 _4234_
"` results in `"1 _2344_ "`.

Return `true` if _it is possible to transform string`s` into string `t`_.
Otherwise, return `false`.

A **substring**  is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: s = "84532", t = "34852"
    Output: true
    Explanation: You can transform s into t using the following sort operations:
    "84 _53_ 2" (from index 2 to 3) -> "84 _35_ 2"
    " _843_ 52" (from index 0 to 2) -> " _348_ 52"
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: s = "34521", t = "23415"
    Output: true
    Explanation: You can transform s into t using the following sort operations:
    " _3452_ 1" -> " _2345_ 1"
    "234 _51_ " -> "234 _15_ "
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    Input: s = "12345", t = "12435"
    Output: false
    

**Example 4:**

    
    
    Input: s = "1", t = "2"
    Output: false
    



**Constraints:**

  * `s.length == t.length`
  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` and `t` only contain digits from `'0'` to `'9'`.
