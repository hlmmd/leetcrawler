You are given an array `words` of strings.

A _move  onto _`s` consists of swapping any two even indexed characters of
`s`, or any two odd indexed characters of `s`.

Two strings `s` and `t` are  _special-equivalent_  if after any number of
_moves onto_`s`, `s == t`.

For example, `s = "zzxy"` and `t = "xyzz"` are special-equivalent because we
may make the moves `"zzxy" -> "xzzy" -> "xyzz"` that swap `s[0]` and `s[2]`,
then `s[1]` and `s[3]`.

Now, a _group of special-equivalent strings from_`words` is a non-empty subset
of `words` such that:

  1. Every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and;
  2. The group is the largest size possible (ie., there isn't a string `s` not in the group such that `s` is special equivalent to every string in the group)

Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from `words`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: words = ["abcd","cdab","cbad","xyzz","zzxy","zzyx"]
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    One group is ["abcd", "cdab", "cbad"], since they are all pairwise special equivalent, and none of the other strings are all pairwise special equivalent to these.
    The other two groups are ["xyzz", "zzxy"] and ["zzyx"].  Note that in particular, "zzxy" is not special equivalent to "zzyx".
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: words = ["abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"]
    Output: 3



**Note:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
  * All `words[i]` have the same length.
  * All `words[i]` consist of only lowercase letters.
