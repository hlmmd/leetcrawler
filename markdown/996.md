Given an array `nums` of non-negative integers, the array is _squareful_ if
for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.

Return the number of permutations of nums that are squareful.  Two
permutations `perm1` and `perm2` differ if and only if there is some index `i`
such that `perm1[i] != perm2[i]`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [1,17,8]
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
    [1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    Input: nums = [2,2,2]
    Output: 1
    



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= nums.length <= 12`
  2. `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`
